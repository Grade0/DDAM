## About the Dataset

#### eCommerce behavior data from multi-category store

The dataset taken into account contains behavior data for only 1 month (March 2020) from a large multi-category online store.

Each row in the file represents an event. All events are related to products and users. Each event is like many-to-many relations between products and users.

There are different types of events. Semantics (or how to read it):   
User **user_id** during session **user_session** added to shopping cart (property **event_type** is equal **cart**) product **product_id** of brand **brand** of category **category_code** with price **price** at **event_time**.

## About the project

This project consists of analyzing the problem of forecasting high seismic bumps in a coal mine with data mining tools. 

This project consists of analyzing a large amount of eCommerce data in order to predict the users' behavior with data mining and Hadoop (Spark) tools. 

The project is divided into four parts as follows: 

- Data Reduction
- Understanding & Preparation
- Features Extraction
- Classification
- Pattern mining
